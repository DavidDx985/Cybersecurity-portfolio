# 📅 Week 2 Documentation  

Forward ever, backward never 🚀. This week had its own chaos (university life doing its thing), but I still pushed through both A+ prep and HackTheBox study.

## 🔹 CompTIA A+ Prep (Professor Messer)  

This week I dove deeper into **laptop hardware** and learned:  

- The different **battery types** and how to properly handle them (hint: don’t treat them like candy bars 🍫).  
- The concept of **form factor**—basically, size really does matter when it comes to fitting components.  
- **Memory modules** like SO-DIMM.  
- **Storage options**: SSD vs HDD (speed demons vs spinning dinosaurs 🦖).  
- **Wireless connectivity**:  
  - Wi-Fi standards (802.11 family reunion).  
  - Bluetooth networking.  
  - NFC (Near Field Communications, aka “phone, please pay for my snacks”).  
- **Connecting mobile devices**:  
  - Wired (Lightning, USB-C, Micro-USB).  
  - Wireless (Wi-Fi sync, Bluetooth, etc).  

Not as much study as I planned, but hey, school work sometimes sneaks in like a ninja and rearranges my schedule.

## 🔹 HackTheBox / Cybersecurity Learning  

This side of my week was *legally heavy* but interesting:  

- Learned about **cybersecurity laws and regulations** across multiple countries (US, UK, China, Europe, India).  
  - CFAA  
  - DMCA  
  - ECPA  
  - HIPAA  
  - COPPA  
  *(Not going into full definitions because I’d rather not misquote the law and end up explaining myself to some federal agent 👀)*  

### 🕵️ Penetration Testing Process  

Reviewed the **pen testing lifecycle** in detail:  

1. **Pre-engagement**  
2. **Information Gathering**  
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**  
4. **Exploitation**  
5. **Post-exploitation**  
6. **Lateral Movement**  
7. **Proof of Concept**  
8. **Post-engagement / Reporting**  

Also explored **deterministic processes** (each step follows logically) vs **stochastic processes** (a little more chaotic, not always tied to previous steps).  

### 📜 Documents & Agreements  

Before you even start poking at systems, there’s paperwork:  

- **NDAs** (Unilateral, Bilateral—the most common, Multilateral). Confidentiality first!  
- **Scoping questionnaire** – sent to clients to understand their needs (internal vs external testing, wireless, web apps, etc).  
- **Scoping document** – where findings are captured.  
- **ISP approvals** – if third-party services like ISPs are in play, seek their approval and blessings before testing on their services 🙏.  
- **Pentest Proposal → Rules of Engagement → Contractor’s Agreement → Final Reports**.  

Key point: **always prioritize the client’s scope.** Don’t go rogue and start testing extra stuff just because *you* think it’s cool. If updates are needed → discuss with them first.

## 📝 Reflection  

- A+ prep was a little lighter this week due to university demands.  
- HackTheBox study went deeper into laws, frameworks, and professional processes.  
- I’m realizing documentation isn’t just for clients—it’s for me too. Helps keep my brain uncluttered.  

Overall, solid progress. The grind continues! 💪

👉 That’s **Week 2 wrapped up**. Less flashy than Week 1 maybe, but hey, it’s all part of building the foundation.
