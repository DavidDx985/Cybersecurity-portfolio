# 🗓️ Week 1 Progress Report

## 🔐 Hack The Box – Penetration Testing Job Pathway  

This week, I kicked off the Penetration Tester Job Pathway on Hack The Box. First impressions? It feels like being handed a treasure map… but instead of gold, the prize is root access.  

I learned about the pentesting process, which is basically a hacker’s version of a recipe:  

- 🍳 **Pre-Engagement** : setting expectations before touching anything.  
- 🔎 **Information Gathering** : aka, digital stalking but with permission.  
- 🧩 **Vulnerability Assessment** : finding the cracks in the wall.  
- 💥 **Exploitation** : carefully poking the cracks until they give way.  
- 🧗 **Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement** : once inside, exploring and moving around like you own the place.  
- 📝 **Proof-of-Concept** : proving you did it (without destroying the system).  
- 🎤 **Post-Engagement** : wrapping things up, reporting, and walking away like a professional.  
- 🔁 **Practice** : because this isn’t a “learn once, forget later” skillset.  

This module also introduced some IT fundamentals, company policies before starting a test (yes, even hackers need paperwork 🗂️), and included a few motivational quotes from the HTB team. Honestly, those quotes felt like pep talks before entering a boss fight — and I kind of needed that.

## 💻 CompTIA A+ Prep – Professor Messer’s Course  

On the A+ side of things, I began Professor Messer’s Complete CompTIA A+ course on YouTube (legend 🙌). Here’s what I covered:  

- 📚 Learned the exam structure: Core 1 + Core 2, what each focuses on, and when they expire.  
- 📝 Understood what the exams actually test — from troubleshooting hardware/software to operational procedures.  
- 🔗 Collected prep links & exam requirements directly from Messer’s resources.  

His teaching style makes even the driest details easy to digest. Honestly, if CompTIA exams were movies, Professor Messer would be the director giving behind-the-scenes commentary.

## ✅ Wrap-up for Week 1  

I officially stepped onto the pentester pathway, mapped out the stages of an ethical hack, and began setting my A+ foundation.  
Feeling good, slightly overwhelmed, but mostly hyped for Week 2. 🚀
