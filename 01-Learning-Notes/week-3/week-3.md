# 🗓️ Week 3 Progress Report

## 💻 CompTIA A+ Prep – Professor Messer’s Course  

This week’s A+ journey took me deeper into the world of **mobile devices and networking**.  

📱 **Mobile Device Accessories**  
I covered the tools and gadgets that make mobile devices more than just… phones. Things like:  
- Digital styluses (for those of us who can’t draw a straight line with a finger)  
- TRRS headsets and their wired vs Bluetooth versions  
- External cameras & webcams  
- Docking stations (making connections neat instead of spaghetti-like)  
- Port replicators, trackpads, and drawing pads  

📡 **Mobile Device Networks**  
Next stop: the actual networks behind the magic.  
- Learned why it’s called a *“cell phone”* (hint: it comes from *cellular networks* back in 1998).  
- Explored 3G → 4G (LTE, based on GSM & EDGE) → 5G (blazing fast 10Gbps+).  
- Airplane mode = no calls, no texts, just you pretending to read the safety card.  
- Also looked at hotspots, SIM vs eSIM, Bluetooth, and GPS.  

🛡️ **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**  
Organizations need to control all their devices, and MDM makes that possible. A couple of concepts stood out:  
- **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** → You bring your own phone/laptop for work. Cheaper for companies, but a nightmare for security if you’re careless.  
- **COPE (Corporate Owned, Personally Enabled)** → The company owns the device, but you can still use it personally. More control, less risk.  

🌐 **Intro to Internet Protocol (IP)**  
Finally, I dipped into networking fundamentals:  
- IP carries data using **TCP** and **UDP** (transport layer of OSI).  
- Covered DHCP, TFTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH.  
- IPv4 sockets carry 3 main pieces: server IP, protocol, and port number.  
- **Ports** →  
  - *Ephemeral ports* = short-lived, dynamic, usually for client-side connections.  
  - *Non-ephemeral ports* = well-known, fixed ones (like 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

## 🔐 Hack The Box – Penetration Testing Job Pathway  

This week’s HTB focus was on **Information Gathering, Vulnerability Assessment, and Exploitation basics**.  

🕵️ **Information Gathering**  
- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):** Digging up info about targets from public sources (yes, sometimes even passwords leak out there).  
- **Infrastructure Enumeration:** Mapping servers, mail, DNS, cloud, and understanding network flow.  
- **Server Enumeration:** Identifying running services, versions, and known vulnerabilities.  
- **Host Enumeration:** Zeroing in on each host’s OS, versions, and configs.  

💀 Learned about **Pillaging** → happens *after* exploitation, when sensitive data is collected.  

🧮 **Vulnerability Assessment**  
This step analyzes findings and classifies them:  
- **Descriptive:** What the vulnerability is.  
- **Diagnostic:** Why it exists.  
- **Predictive:** What might happen if exploited.  
- **Prescriptive:** How to fix or mitigate it.  

🔎 Also explored **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** databases for known exploits.  

🔁 **The Return:** Sometimes you find nothing juicy in assessment, so you loop back to information gathering.  

💥 **Exploitation**  
The fun part — adapting weaknesses into actual access:  
- Prioritize attacks based on:  
  1. Probability of success  
  2. Complexity  
  3. Potential damage  
- If a proof-of-concept exploit doesn’t exist, replicate the system in a VM, test safely, refine, then execute.

## ✅ Wrap-Up for Week 3  

This week was **dense but productive**: I leveled up my A+ prep by understanding mobile devices, networks, and IP, while also diving deep into HTB’s info gathering → vuln assessment → exploitation flow.  

Progress feels steady — some days it’s a grind, but every command typed and every note written feels like another brick in the hacker’s toolkit.  

✨ **Inspiration of the Week:**  
*“Don’t measure your progress by how far you have to go. Measure it by how far you’ve come.”*  

On to Week 4 🚀
